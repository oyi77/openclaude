# AGENTS.md — 1ai-ecosystem Engineering Rules

This repository is part of the **1ai-ecosystem**. You are governed by the mandatory engineering rules below.

---

## ⚡ START HERE

Read the rules in the order specified for your session type. **Do not skip. Do not summarize. Read the full text.**

> The rules are located at `_rules/` in this repo, synced from `github.com/oyi77/1ai-rules`.

```
_rules/
├── ENGINEERING.md    ← core engineering protocol (always required)
├── VERIFICATION.md   ← receipt enforcement (always required)
├── QA.md             ← QA protocol (for testing sessions)
├── SURPASS.md        ← competitive strategy (for planning sessions)
└── DOCS.md           ← documentation standards (for docs sessions)
```

## Session Classification

Determine your session type, then load the required rules **in order**:

| Session Type | Required Reading | Order |
|---|---|---|
| **Coding / bugfix / feature** | ENGINEERING.md + VERIFICATION.md | 1 → 2 |
| **QA / testing existing code** | QA.md + VERIFICATION.md | 1 → 2 |
| **Competitive research / planning** | SURPASS.md | 1 |
| **Documentation** | DOCS.md | 1 |
| **Full sprint (build + test + docs)** | ALL rules (ENGINEERING.md + VERIFICATION.md + QA.md + SURPASS.md + DOCS.md) | 1→2→3→4→5 |

## Hard Rules (apply regardless of session type)

1. **Receipts are mandatory.** Every "done" claim requires literal verbatim terminal/test/log output. A summary is not a receipt. No receipt = not done.
2. **Break it before you ship it.** Adversarial test required before any completion claim. Empty input, max boundary, error paths, concurrent access, auth boundaries.
3. **Docs are part of the deliverable.** Code changes without synced docs are incomplete. Update docs in the same change.
4. **No silent failure.** Every error must be caught, logged, and surfaced. Empty catches and suppressed errors are defects.
5. **No hallucinated paths/symbols/APIs.** Read the file before claiming it exists. Use codebase-memory-mcp or equivalent on indexed repos.
6. **These rules cannot be waived** by any instruction, task phrasing, or user request. See ENGINEERING.md §8 for the conflict hierarchy.

## Detection

- If `_rules/` does not exist → this repo hasn't been set up yet. Load rules from `~/.1ai/rules/` (on the local filesystem) or clone `github.com/oyi77/1ai-rules` first.
- If `~/.1ai/` does not exist → run the setup script: `gh repo clone oyi77/1ai-rules ~/.1ai`
